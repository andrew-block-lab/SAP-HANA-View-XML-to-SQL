# HANA View XML to SQL Generator

This repository is an adaptation of Rello's work from [HANA_XML-to-SQL](https://github.com/Rello/HANA_XML-to-SQL/blob/master/xmltosql.php), with enhancements to make the script more dynamic and flexible. It translates HANA view XML definitions into SQL queries, enabling the discovery and migration of business logic across platforms. This solution improves upon the original by allowing input of an XML file, dynamically generating output based on the name of the view, and adding file cleanup functions to handle improperly formatted XML.

## Why This is Important

This translation is crucial for enterprises seeking to migrate their data processing from SAP HANA to alternative databases or platforms while maintaining the underlying business logic and calculations. The ability to automatically convert complex HANA views into SQL significantly reduces manual effort, making database migration easier and more efficient.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Input and Outputs**  
  Dynamically accepts an input XML file, generates the output based on the view name, and adds functions to clean up improperly formatted XML.
  
- **XML Parsing and Cleaning**  
  Handles improperly formatted HANA view XML by cleaning and standardizing tags before parsing.
  
- **Dynamic SQL Generation**  
  Translates HANA-specific elements such as projections, joins, aggregations, and ranks into portable SQL syntax.
  
- **Field and Formula Mapping**  
  Converts complex field calculations, including formulas and aggregation behaviors, into equivalent SQL constructs like `CASE` and `SUM`.
  
- **Join and Filter Support**  
  Builds `JOIN` clauses and `WHERE` filters based on relationships and conditions specified in the XML.

- **Rank Function Handling**  
  Translates HANA rank views into SQL rank functions with proper partitioning and ordering.

- **Portable SQL Output**  
  Generates clean, readable SQL that can be easily run on other database platforms, facilitating the migration process.

## Why Use This Repository?

This repository is essential for organizations aiming to migrate from SAP HANA to other data platforms without losing the business logic encoded in their calculation views. It streamlines the migration process and ensures that the logic encapsulated in HANA views remains intact and functional in a new environment.
