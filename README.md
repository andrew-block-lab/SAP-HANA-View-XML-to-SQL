# hana-view-xml-to-sql
This repository is designed to translate HANA view XML definitions into SQL queries, enabling the discovery and migration of business logic across platforms. By parsing complex XML files that define HANA calculation views, this solution helps in converting them into SQL statements, ensuring compatibility with other database systems.

This translation is particularly crucial for enterprises looking to migrate their data processing from SAP HANA to alternative databases or platforms while maintaining the underlying business logic and calculations. The ability to automatically convert these complex views into SQL significantly reduces the manual effort required for database migration and enables better portability and maintainability of legacy systems.

Key Features:
XML Parsing and Cleaning: Handles improperly formatted HANA view XML by cleaning and standardizing tags before parsing.
Dynamic SQL Generation: Translates HANA-specific elements such as projections, joins, aggregations, and ranks into portable SQL syntax.
Field and Formula Mapping: Converts complex field calculations, including formulas and aggregation behaviors, into equivalent SQL constructs like CASE and SUM.
Supports Joins and Filtering: Builds JOIN clauses and WHERE filters based on the relationships and conditions specified in the XML.
Rank Function Handling: Translates HANA rank views into SQL rank functions with proper partitioning and ordering.
Portable SQL Output: Generates clean, readable SQL that can be easily run on other database platforms, facilitating the migration process.
This repository is essential for organizations that aim to migrate from SAP HANA to other SQL-based platforms without losing the business logic encoded in their calculation views. It streamlines the migration process and ensures that the logic encapsulated in these HANA views remains intact and functional in a new environment.
